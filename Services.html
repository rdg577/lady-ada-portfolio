                    I was presented at Court at the age of seventeen "and became a popular belle of the season" in part because of my "brilliant mind". By 1834 I was a regular at Court and started attending various events.
When I was a teenager (18), my mathematical talents led me to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". I was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. I first met him in June 1833, through my mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. 
Between 1842 and 1843, I translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes".That Notes is what many consider to be the first computer programâ€”that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. I also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. My mindset of "poetical science" led me to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in my notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
I visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments. In the same year, I wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.. I am a mathematician, software developer, writer and considered a computer scientist.
