            During a nine-month period in 1842â€“43 I translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.  With the article, I appended a set of notes. Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task; many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it. My notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. My work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of my writing.
The notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Note G), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002). Based on this work,I am now now considered by many to be the first computer programmer and my method has been called the world's first computer program. Others dispute this because some of Charles Babbage's earlier writings could be considered computer programs. 
Note G also contains my dismissal of artificial intelligence.I wrote that "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" Most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers.
My notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, I describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and I has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed and so my program was never tested but now has been recognised as an early model for a computer and my notes as a description of a computer and software
