            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815
            – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
            known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
            general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first
            to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
            calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to
            be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded
            as the first computer programmer.[2][3][4]

            Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady
            Byron.[5] All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to
            other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was
            born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated
            the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my
            fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"[7] He died in
            Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted
            Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her
            from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada
            remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon.
            Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although
            often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She
            married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in
            1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

            Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with
            scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David
            Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author
            Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education.
            Ada described her approach as "poetical science"[8] and herself as
            an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".[9]
          </p>
          <p>
            When she was a teenager (18), her mathematical talents led her to a
            long working relationship and friendship with fellow British
            mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of
            computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on
            the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through
            their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.

            Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military
            engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing
            it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes". Lovelace's
            notes are important in the early history of computers, containing
            what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an
            algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians
            reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes
            from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the
            engine.[10] She also developed a vision of the capability of
            computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while
            many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those
            capabilities.[11] Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask
            questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes)
            examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a
            collaborative tool.[6]
